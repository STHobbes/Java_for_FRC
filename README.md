# Java_for_FRC

This is a project with simple coding lessons and examples to help students get up
to speed in using the [WPIlib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/) Java framework
for FIRST FRC robot programming. The big
obstacle here is the steep initial learning curve because of the very
structured *'everything needs to be a class'* nature of Java, the complexity
of the WPIlib framework, and that running/debugging robot code without a robot or
a robot simulation is a problem. So learning to code on the robot is not a good
recipe for success.

The topics are laid out in jupyter notebooks so students can learn and exercise
the fundamental language concepts of syntax, types, keywords, and logic before
worrying about classes, inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes, etc.
